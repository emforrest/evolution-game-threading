# evolution-game-threading
A redevelopment of a small game simulation I made a while ago, this time using threading techniques

As part of my part-time work at a gymnastics club, I get to lead fun games for children aged 4-12 during summer camp. A few years ago one of my colleagues brought forth a game, which we titled the Evolution game, which challenged the kids to use their imaginations to evolve into different animals while successively playing rock paper scissors. Essentially, each child begins as an egg, and can immediately play rock paper scissors with any other egg. If they win, they evolve into a chicken, but chickens can only play rock paper scissors with other chickens. Winning as a chicken means evolving into an eagle, followed by a T-rex, followed by a dragon. If they win as a dragon then they have 'won' the game. Once the children have got the hang of it, I would introduce devolving back down a level if they lose. Pretty simple, but very entertaining watching 20 children flapping chicken arms or stomping like a dinosaur!

One summer I wanted to practise my Java coding in preparation for the upcoming year at uni, and had the idea to turn this game into a simulation in a small Java program. Since then I have become more comfortable with Java as well as learning advanced techniques including threading, which I have realised would suit the all-at-once nature of this game much better than random sequence. So in this repo I am going to recreate it, just for fun.
